## Setup ðŸ”§

Here is how to setup this template:

<p>1. Clone the repository.</p>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/demon-bixia/Avian-Template.git
```

<p>2. Install dependencies.</p>

```bash
npm install
```

<p>3. Run the development server.</p>

```bash
npm run dev
```

<br/>

## Deployment ðŸš€

This project includes scripts for versioned deployment and rollback functionality.

<p>1. Make deployment scripts executable (only once after cloning):</p>

```bash
# Option 1: Make the prepare script executable first
chmod +x prepare-scripts.sh
./prepare-scripts.sh

# Option 2: Use bash to run without changing permissions
bash prepare-scripts.sh
```

<p>2. Run the setup script to prepare your environment (only once per server):</p>

```bash
./setup.sh
```

<p>3. Build your project:</p>

```bash
npm run build
```

<p>4. Deploy a new version:</p>

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will:

- Create a new versioned release (e.g., `1-20230701`)
- Copy files from the `dist` directory to the release folder
- Update the symbolic link to point to the new version
- Keep only the 5 most recent versions

<p>5. If needed, rollback to a previous version:</p>

```bash
# Rollback to the previous version
./rollback.sh

# Rollback to a specific version by number
./rollback.sh 2

# Rollback to a specific version by full name
./rollback.sh 2-20230620
```

<p>6. Configure Nginx for web access:</p>

```bash
# Configure with your IP address (for testing)
./create-nginx-config.sh --ip 192.168.1.100

# Configure with your domain name
./create-nginx-config.sh --name your-domain.com

# Configure with custom port (useful when multiple sites on same server)
./create-nginx-config.sh --ip 192.168.1.100 --port 8080

# Get help
./create-nginx-config.sh --help
```

This will create and install an Nginx configuration file, allowing you to access your application through a web browser. You can start with an IP address for testing and later switch to a domain name when it's available.

## Development Workflow ðŸ”„

This project follows structured development practices:

### Commit Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for standardized commit messages. To make a commit:

```bash
npm run commit
```

This will guide you through creating a properly formatted commit message.

### Versioning

For versioning and changelog generation:

```bash
npm run release
```

This automatically determines the next version based on your commits, updates package.json, and generates a CHANGELOG.md file.
